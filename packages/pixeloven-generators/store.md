# Generating stores

Pixeloven comes with itâ€™s own store generator to produce all the files you need to start working on a fresh store. To begin:

1. Run `yarn pixeloven-generators`.
2. Choose `store`.
3. Give the service a name (our naming convention is `PascaleCase`).
4. Give the service resource a name (our naming convention is `PascaleCase`).
5. Choose ow the service will communicate with the resource.
10. Enjoy your new store.

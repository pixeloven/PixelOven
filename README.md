## Statement

This project was born from a small collective effort within ***GoFundMe*** with the purpose to abstract common configuration and infrastructure used in the creation of *isomorphic* React applications.

***PixelOven*** is a development CLI that gets inspiration form amazing work done by the [create-react-app project](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and other similar projects. Our goal is to build a highly extensible CLI that focuses on testability, type safety and a plugin/addon first approach.

For this project to see continued success we need your help. **Join us and start coding!** :heart:

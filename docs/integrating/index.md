# Guides
Below is documentation on some general integration best practices. This section should be maintained by developers as they discover and use features of PixelOven. Much of PixelOven is based on practices founded by the React community at large and so this list is meant to represent our opinions on how development should be done. 

**Google** is still your best friend ;)

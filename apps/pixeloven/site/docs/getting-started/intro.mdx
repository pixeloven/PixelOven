Welcome to PixelOven! The goal of this project is to wrap and when possible enhance some of the amazing tooling available for web development.

> Note: PixelOven's core CLI represents our own opinions on development and release processes. However, we also strive to provide more general alternatives for those looking for highly customized workflows. If something is missing please consider [contributing](/docs/contribution/intro) or dropping us a [recommendation or file a bug](https://github.com/pixeloven/pixeloven/issues).

## Getting Started

PixelOven's core CLI provides some basic out of the box commands for creating managing your project. The usages below assuming execution with yarn but npm and other package managers should work just as well.

> TBD from scratch with init script + manual setup for existing or custom projects

## Manual Installation

To install the core CLI simply run the following with NPM

```sh
npm install --save-dev @pixeloven/cli
```

or via yarn

```sh
yarn add --dev @pixeloven/cli
```

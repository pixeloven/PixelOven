## CLI: PixelOven.Pretty
The Pretty API provides a proxy for Prettier while providing a light abstraction for configuration. Prettier's own auto-fixing features help maintain code compliance and reduce friction between developers around formatting.

### General

Prettier supports multiple languages out of the gate. As a result unlike [CLI: PixelOven.Lint](cli-pixelovenlint) this CLI has no need for arguments to be passed to handle for different languages.

#### Options
For reference on all the available options please review the [official documentation](https://prettier.io/) for Prettier. 

#### Setup
First be sure to create a **prettier.json** file at the root of the project or in other words adjacent to the **package.json**.
```json
{
    "trailingComma": "all",
    "tabWidth": 4
}
```
> It is important to note that PixelOven makes a few assumptions for ease integration and will default to Prettier's own default values if a config is not provided. The CLI will warn if this configuration is missing.

#### Usage
Once this has been confirmed all we have to do is run the following.
```bash
yarn run pixeloven pretty
```
We can also target specific files.
```bash
yarn run pixeloven pretty ./src/index.ts
```
Prettier's options can be passed through the CLI but it is highly recommended that this behavior be managed with in a **prettier.json** file.

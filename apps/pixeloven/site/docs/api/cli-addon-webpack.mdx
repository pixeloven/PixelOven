[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is in many regards a must have for large scale JS Application development. Through it's numerous extensions it also supports many other crucial aspects for web development. The goal of this addon is to abstract a lot of the complex configuration requred to get a solid workflow setup for large scale application development.

This addon is meant to allow the CLI to use webpack as a bundler on top of a a TypeScript compiler. It includes many of the plugins and features expected from a fully production ready JavaScript application. Also included is a completely custom development server built to handle both client and server side JavaScript development.

## Installation

> Note: the current version of this extension was specifically designed for creating server side rendered react applications. Though our ultimate goal is to provide a more general development platform we want to first nail this subset before conquering others.

To install this addon simply run the following with NPM

```bash
npm install --save-dev @pixeloven/cli-addon-webpack
```

or yarn

```bash
yarn add --dev @pixeloven/cli-addon-webpack
```

| [`webpack`](#cli-pixelovenwebpack) | CLI entry point for interfacing with Webpack. |

> NOTICE: This API is likely to be broken into a set of more modular APIs in future versions.

Our webpack CLI Addon builds on top of webpack and many other supporting projects to create a system for developing and building JavaScript applications that scale.

| Argument | Required | Default | Description                      |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| `<task>` | Yes      | N/A     | Determines how to build Webpack. |

Based on the task provided Webpack will be built in one of two modes.

| Argument | Description                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `build`  | Builds Webpack for production.                    |
| `start`  | Runs Webpack in watch mode for local development. |

### Options

These options provide more general customization through webpack. For options specific to [Development](#development) or [Production](#production) builds can be found below.

| Option              | Default | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--allow-externals` | `false` | Allows bundling of external dependencies. This is automatic for client builds. Node/Server builds require this to be passed explicitly. |
| `--path`            | `/`     | Public path an application will be mounted at. Generally the default value is recommended.                                              |
| `--source-map`      | `false` | Sets a flag for webpack to include source mapping.                                                                                      |

| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--profile`   | `false`   | Sets a flag for webpack to output "records" with profiling.                           |
| `--stats`     | `false`   | Output static "stats" via `webpack-bundle-analyzer`.                                  |
| `--stats-dir` | `./stats` | Provides directory path for stats output. Generally the default value is recommended. |

| Option          | Default          | Description                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--development` | `false`          | Tells Webpack to run in development mode. The default is "production".                                                      |
| `--host`        | `localhost`      | Host development server will be running on. Generally the default value is recommended.                                     |
| `--ignored`     | `/node_modules/` | Defines a pattern for ignoring paths for file watching.                                                                     |
| `--path`        | `false`          | Sets a flag for webpack to output "records" with profiling and stats.                                                       |
| `--poll`        | `500`            | Set polling frequency. `false` signifies no polling. Generally the default value is recommended.                            |
| `--port`        | `8080`           | Port to bind development server to.                                                                                         |
| `--protocol`    | `http`           | Expected protocol for development server.                                                                                   |
| `--stats`       | `false`          | Run "stats" via `webpack-bundle-analyzer` in a hosted server.                                                               |
| `--stats-host`  | `false`          | Host stats server will be running on. Generally the default value is recommended.                                           |
| `--stats-port`  | `8081+1`         | Sets the base port for both client and server "stats" using `webpack-bundle-analyzer`. Requires two consecutive open ports. |

It is recommended to keep polling on for cross platform purposes. File watching can be CPU intensive if a system falls back to **fs.watchFile** versus utilizing file system events with fs.watch. This is common on linux environments.

### Usage

To run Webpack in development/watch mode on a specific port you.

```bash
yarn run pixeloven webpack start \
    --client ./src/client/index.tsx \
    --server ./src/server/index.ts \
    --allow-externals \
    --development \
    --source-map \
    --host localhost \
    --path / \
    --port 8080 \
    --protocol http
```

Or build with Webpack for production.

```bash
yarn run pixeloven webpack build \
    --client ./src/client/index.tsx \
    --server ./src/server/index.ts \
    --allow-externals \
    --stats \
    --path /
```

Of course you can also just use the default values which are recommended.

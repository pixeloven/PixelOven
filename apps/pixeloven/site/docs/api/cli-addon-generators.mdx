This addon features an interactive CLI for generating common project files. The goal of this addon is to reduce the need for repeative boilerplating usually required by developers.

To install this addon simply run the following with NPM
```bash
npm install --save-dev @pixeloven/cli-addon-generators
```
or yarn
```bash
yarn add --dev @pixeloven/cli-addon-generators

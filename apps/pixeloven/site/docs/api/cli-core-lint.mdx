## CLI: PixelOven.Lint
The Lint API provides a proxy for TsLint as well as StyleLint for handling linting for SCSS, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript.

### Styles
|Argument|Description|
|---|---|
|`css`| An alias for `scss`. Implemented to help differentiate CSS from SCSS.|
|`scss`| A proxy for the StyleLint linter with a few opinionated defaults for easier setup. |

#### Options
For reference on all the available options please review the [official documentation](https://stylelint.io/) for StyleLint. 

> It is important to note that currently this feature expects a **stylelint.json** file to be present at the root of the package to configure the compiler.

#### Setup
First be sure to create a **stylelint.json** file at the root of the project or in other words adjacent to the **package.json**.
```json
{
    "extends": "stylelint-config-recommended-scss"
}

```
PixelOven by default provides [stylelint-config-recommended-scss](https://github.com/kristerkari/stylelint-config-recommended-scss) as a dependency and highly recommends using this as a starting point for all SCSS based projects.

#### Usage
Once this has been confirmed all we have to do is run the following.
```
yarn run pixeloven lint scss
```
We can also target specific files.
```
yarn run pixeloven lint scss ./src/index.scss
```
StyleLint options can be passed through the CLI but it is highly recommended that this behavior be managed with in a **stylelint.json** file.

### TypeScript
> It is important to note that currently this feature expects a **tslint.json** file to be present at the root of the package to configure the compiler.

|Argument|Description|
|---|---|
|`ts`| A proxy for the TSLint linter with a few opinionated defaults for easier setup. |
|`tsx`| An alias for `ts`. Implemented to help differentiate JSX based projects.|

#### Options
For reference on all the available options please review the [official documentation](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) for TSLint. 

#### Setup
First be sure to create a **tslint.json** file at the root of the project or in other words adjacent to the **package.json**.
```json
{
  "defaultSeverity": "error",
  "extends": [
    "tslint:latest",
    "tslint-config-prettier",
    "tslint-eslint-rules"
  ]
}
```
PixelOven by default provides [tslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/tslint-config-prettier) for compatibility between TSLint and Prettier as well as [tslint-eslint-rules](https://github.com/buzinas/tslint-eslint-rules) to match rules against ESLint.

#### Usage
Once this has been confirmed all we have to do is run the following.
```
yarn run pixeloven lint ts
```
We can also target specific files.
```
yarn run pixeloven lint ts ./src/index.ts
```
TSLint options can be passed through the CLI but it is highly recommended that this behavior be managed with in a **tslint.json** file.

## CLI: PixelOven.Copy
Copy is a utility API that helps copy static assets from src directories into a distribution directory. This can be useful for when developing component libraries that depend on static components throughout the development life cycle.

### By Pattern
|Argument|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`<source>`| Yes | **N/A** | Source path directory to copy from |
|`<dest>`| No | `./disb/lib` | Destination path to copy to |
|`<pattern>`| No | `./**/*.{ico,scss,svg}` | Matching pattern for source files |

There are three arguments available for copy files. All paths and patterns are relative to where the command is invoked.

#### Usage
While source is a required field both dest and the given pattern are not. Source generally is a path but can also be one of a few keywords. 
```bash
yarn run pixeloven copy <source> <dest[optional]> <pattern[optional]>
``` 
More information about these `<source>` keywords can be found in our [Shortcuts](#shortcuts) section below.

When `<source>` is not one of the args from above, `copy` will attempt to copy all contents of the source path/file to the provided dest path/file.
```
yarn run pixeloven copy /work/dir/file.txt /dist/lib/custom/dir/file.txt
```

Optionally we can provide a pattern to match specific file types against when copying between two locations.
```
yarn run pixelove copy /work/dir /dist/lib **.tsx
```
A common pattern where this might be used is as a post command hook after a compilation step has completed.
```json
"scripts": {
    "compile": "pixeloven compile ts",
    "postcompile": "pixeloven copy src dist/lib **.{scss,jpg}"
}
```


### Shortcuts
> Note: The shortcuts listed below are based on our own opinions for directory structure. They are provided as a convenience
|Argument|Description|
|---|---|
|`ico`| Copies `.ico` files |
|`scss`| Copies `.scss` files |
|`svg`| Copies `.svg` files  |
|`assets`| Functions as an alias for combing all of the above cmds. |

All files in all subdirectories relative to where the command is run that have the file extension matching that of the above keywords will be copied to a default `./disb/lib` directory. If the source provided is of an existing directory or file path, `copy` will attempt to copy all *contents* of the provided source path to a default `./dist/lib` 

#### Usage
The general pattern for these shortcuts follows the below pattern.
```
yarn run pixeloven copy <source>
```
A more specific example for copying scss into our distribution directory might look like the following.
```
pixeloven copy scss
```
As with the more general version a common pattern is to use this as a post command hook.
```json
"scripts": {
    "compile": "pixeloven compile ts",
    "postcompile": "pixeloven copy assets"
}
```

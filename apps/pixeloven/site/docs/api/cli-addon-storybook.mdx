[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an amazing tool for developing components in isolation out side of the constraints for a more standard application workflow. Because of this we wanted to provide an extension to PixelOven that would provide support for storybook. 

## Installation
>Note the currently version of this extension only supports react as that is the primary use case for PixelOven. Though our ultimate goal is to provide a more general development platform we want to first nail this subset before conquering others.

To install this addon simply run the following with NPM
```bash
npm install --save-dev @pixeloven/cli-addon-storybook
```
or yarn
```bash
yarn add --dev @pixeloven/cli-addon-storybook
```

## API Reference
|Argument|Description|
|---|---|
|[`story`](#cli-pixelovenstory)| CLI entry point for interfacing with Storybook. |

Story wraps the standalone implementation of storybook while also abstracting away the configuration to work closely with the rest of PixelOven's CLI. This addon shares some dependencies with our [webpack addon](/docs/api/cli-addon-webpack) to maintain a similar level of support for Typescript, SCSS and other important features.

|Argument|Required|Default|Description|

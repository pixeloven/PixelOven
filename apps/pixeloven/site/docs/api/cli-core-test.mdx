## Overview

> NOTICE: This feature will be removed from the core cli and become an addon in a future update.

Test is a simple wrapper for testing JavaScript applications. It currently acts as proxy for the Jest compiler and comes with a dependecies to make it more compatible with TypeScript.

## Jest

> It is important to note that currently this feature expects a **jest.json** file to be present at the root of the package to configure the compiler.

For reference on all the available configurations please review the [official documentation](https://jestjs.io/) for Jest.

### Setup

First be sure to create a **jest.json** file at the root of the project or in other words adjacent to the **package.json**.

```json
{
    "bail": true,
    "collectCoverageFrom": [
        "!<rootDir>/**/*.stories.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
        "!<rootDir>/**/*.test.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
        "<rootDir>/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"
    ],
    "coverageDirectory": "<rootDir>/../coverage",
    "coverageThreshold": {
        "global": {
            "branches": 0,
            "functions": 0,
            "lines": 0,
            "statements": 0
        }
    },
    "moduleFileExtensions": ["js", "json", "jsx", "ts", "tsx"],
    "preset": "ts-jest",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "testEnvironment": "node",
    "testMatch": ["<rootDir>/**/*.test.(j|t)s?(x)"],
    "transform": {
        "^.+\\.(ts|tsx)$": "ts-jest"
    },
    "transformIgnorePatterns": [
        "[/\\\\]node_modules[/\\\\].+\\.(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)$"
    ],
    "verbose": true
}
```

### Options

For reference on all the available options please review the [official documentation](https://jestjs.io/) for Jest.

### Usage

Once this has been confirmed all we have to do is run the following.

```bash
yarn run pixeloven test --watch
```

or perhaps as part of a CI workflow:

```bash
yarn run pixeloven test --ci --coverage
```

Jest has an extensive CLI and so it is recommended to review their documentation for all the available options. Proper configuration through **jest.json** is also highly recommended.

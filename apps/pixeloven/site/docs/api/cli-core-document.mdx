## Overview

> DEPRECATED: This feature has been removed as standalone CLI extension. We are exploring alternative methods such as https://github.com/microsoft/Typedoc-Webpack-Plugin

Document is a wrapper for type doc and is therefore dependent on TypeScript. As such it follows a similar pattern as our own [Compile](#compile) cmd.

## TypeScript

> It is important to note that currently this feature expects both a **tsconfig.json** and **typedoc.json** file to be present at the root of the package for TypeDoc to run.

| Argument | Description                                                                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ts`     | A proxy for the TypeDoc API with a few opinionated defaults for easier setup. |
| `tsx`    | An alias for `ts`. Implemented to help differentiate JSX based projects.      |

### Options

For reference on all the available options please review the [official documentation](https://typedoc.org/) for TypeDoc.

### Setup

First be sure to create a **tsconfig.json** file at the root of the project or in other words adjacent to the **package.json**.

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "rootDir": "./src",
        "declarationDir": "./dist/types",
        "outDir": "./dist/lib"
    }
}
```

Second make sure to have a configuration file for TypeDoc like seen below.

```json
{
    "name": "@project/name",
    "target": "es5",
    "out": "docs",
    "exclude": "*.{test}.{ts}",
    "externalPattern": "**/node_modules/**",
    "excludeExternals": true,
    "includeDeclarations": true
}
```

The above configuration files are not exhaustive examples but instead represents our recommendation for getting started. Please review the official documentation for more advanced configurations.

### Usage

Once configured we can create our documentation from our source using a cmd similar what you see below.

```bash
yarn run pixeloven document ts ./src
```

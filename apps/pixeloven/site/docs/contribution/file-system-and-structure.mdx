title: File System and Structure
---

General overview of PixelOven's file structure and recommended application structure for projects using our CLI.

## File structure
The structure of this application should be considered living. As new requirements are needed this structure should be able to adapt to change. With that said there was a fair attempt to plan for the future. Below is a quick break down of this structure.
```
./
├── .github/
├── apps/
│   ├── examples/
│   └── pixeloven/
├── docker/
├── docusaurus/
├── node_modules/
├── packages/
│   ├── examples/
│   ├── pixeloven/
│   ├── pixeloven-core/
│   ├── pixeloven-express/
│   ├── pixeloven-react/
│   ├── pixeloven-storybook/
│   └── pixeloven-webpack/
└── scripts/

```

### PixelOven Root structure
|Directory|Description|
|---|---|
|`.github`|GitHub configuration|
|`apps`|Workspace for all applications including examples.|
|`docker`|Docker setup files for custom images|
|`docusaurus`|General documentation for PixelOven and recommended best practices for using our CLI|
|`node_modules`|I would hope this is understood ;) but this is also a transient directory used to store our general dependencies.|
|`packages`|Workspace for all packages including examples.|
|`scripts`|Scripts used to help onboarding as well as our build process.|

### PixelOven App structure
|Directory|Description|
|---|---|
|`examples`|Workspace for example applications to help with onboarding and testing.|
|`pixeloven`|Workspace for PixelOven sites and apps.|

### PixelOven Package structure
|Directory|Description|
|---|---|
|`examples`|Workspace for example packages to help with onboarding, testing and abstracting common example logic.|
|`pixeloven`|Workspace for core CLI implementation.|
|`pixeloven-core`|Workspace for core logic common to any project|
|`pixeloven-express`|Workspace express abstractions to help support server based applications including our own dev server.|
|`pixeloven-react`|Workspace react abstractions for common react development|
|`pixeloven-storybook`|Workspace for storybook CLI logic|
|`pixeloven-webpack`|Workspace for webpack CLI logic|

### File extensions
It should be noted that we use both `.ts` and `.tsx`. The general rule is any file that has ***JSX*** should use the `.tsx` extension. Everything else should be `.ts`. The `.js` and `.jsx` extensions are not supported as this is a pure TypeScript environment.

### File designations
Beyond just the above extensions we have a few other designations. First we have `.stories.tsx` which allow us to render out components in isolation. Second we have `.test.tsx` which are part of our unit testing environment. Both of these designations are matched by pattern and should be present for **all** components.

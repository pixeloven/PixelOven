## Application files structure

This section is both documentation for our own application structure and recommended structure for derivative apps.

```
apps/pixeloven/site/
├── coverage/
├── dist/
├── node_modules/
├── src/
│   ├── client/
│   ├── server/
│   │   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── middleware/
│   │   └── views/
│   ├── shared
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   │   ├── atoms/
│   │   │   ├── molecules/
│   │   │   ├── organisms/
│   │   │   ├── pages/
│   │   │   ├── partials/
│   │   │   └── templates/
└── stats/
...
```

Starting with each application you will find the following structure.

| Directory      | Description                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `coverage`     | This is a transient directory. It should not be relied on for adding any permanent files. All test coverage files can be found here. |
| `dist`         | This is a transient directory. It should not be relied on for adding any permanent files. All production files can be found here.    |
| `node_modules` | I would hope this is understood ;) but this is also a transient directory used to store our applications dependencies.               |
| `src`          | Alright the fun part! Contains all the source files used to build our application.                                                   |
| `stats`        | Webpack bundle analysis stats                                                                                                        |

### Source files and aliases

Our source files require a bit more in depth discussion. Our source files are meant to be built in an isomorphic style. Isomorphic or Universal JavaScript is meant to reduce the amount of repeated code and context switching but often comes at the cost of complexity. We introduced a simple file structure to help us reduce thrashing when working in this context.

| Directory    | Description                                                                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/client` | This is the entry point for our build process for all client side code paths. |
| `src/server` | This is the entry point for our build process for all server side code paths. |
| `src/shared` | Contains all source that is universal to the two code paths.                  |

### Atomic design structure

Further down into our `src/shared/components` directory structure we have adopted Atomic Design philosophies for creating and managing react components. Please reference [react-atomic-design](https://github.com/danilowoz/react-atomic-design) for details on what Atomic Design is and how it is applied to react.

> Note it is worth mentioning that we use our own customized setup but generally all the same patterns still apply.

For reference when we refer to `un-connected` or `connected` we are referring to a components to the relationship application state (redux).

#### Un-connected elements

These comments are blind to application state but all may contain logic or internal state mechanisms. As a general rule the further up the atomic structure you go the more complex both logic and state may become.

-   `atoms` The smallest based elements used as building blocks for everything else. These often are very self contained units are almost purely stateless.
-   `molecules` Often made up of a small collection of atoms. They generally follow a similar rule as atoms but at a slightly larger scale.
-   `organisms` Like molecules to atoms these elements are made up of a collection of both. They often will contain some internal logic or state.

#### Connected elements

Though these elements are generally connected to an application state it is not a requirement. Anyone of these may rely on purely component state or even be completely static.

-   `pages` Pages are made up of a collection of our atomic elements they are almost always connected to state and are highly specific.
-   `partials` Partials are some what in between the two other components of this class. They are some what self contained sections that may are may not be reusable but are not application entry points. Usually a Page may consist of a few of these in the case of a modal or a popup.
-   `templates` Similar to pages these elements are made up of atomic elements and are also often connected to state. However, where they differ is in them not being very specific but instead striving for a generic stance.

## Component structure

When creating any new components we should follow the below pattern. In this example we will assume that we are creating a small `atomic` component. However, it should be noted that these same patterns should apply regardless of scope.

First we must decide where our component should live.

```
...
components
└── atoms
```

Once this decision has been made we will want to created our component directory. In this directory we should define all our independent pieces such that the name of the component comes first followed by what it is used for.

```

This document is general advice for working with React components.

## Referencing source files

To make referencing source files easier we have set up a `@shared` directory alias to simplify import declarations vs having to navigate up and down the directory tree. For example, to import a Logo Atom into another component we'd write:

```javascript
import { Logo } from "@shared/components/atoms/Logo";
```

Alternatively we can also create an `index.ts` file in the atoms directory and export all of our Atom components, allowing us to reference multiple at once.

> Note: Be extremely cautious when importing from a shared directory such as this. If the component we're importing into is exported from the same directory as the component we're importing, it will create a circular dependency. This can create bugs that are difficult to track down, slow down our application, or even create heap memory issues that result in our application crashing.

```javascript
import { Button, Link, Logo } from "@shared/components/atoms";
```

We provide a few aliases for our source directories, refer to the [Design Patterns documentation to learn more](/docs/recommendations/design-patterns#source-file-structure-and-aliases).

## Supporting files

We rely on co-location for our component's supporting files, including styles, tests, stories, and documentation. We find co-locating the supporting files makes development far easier versus spreading them throughout the application. We highly recommend that all `stories.tsx` be accompanied by a `README.md` file to document and aid other developers working with the component.

The `index.ts` file is necessary, but only to export the component at the component directory level and shouldn't contain any other component code. For example, to export the component we'd write:

```javascript
/**
 * Register components here
 */
export { default as Logo } from "./Logo";

// We may also export the connected version if present
export { default as LogoConnected } from "./Logo.connect";
```

## Connecting a component to state

If this component needs to _connect_ to [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) state then it will also need a co-located connect file.

```
Logo.connect.ts
```

Here's a simplified example of what this file might look like.

```javascript
const makeMapStateToProps = () => {
    const mapStateToProps = (state: State, ownProps: OwnProps) => ({

    });
    return mapStateToProps;
};

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch: Dispatch, ownProps: OwnProps) => {

});

const LogoConnect = connect(
    makeMapStateToProps,
    mapDispatchToProps,
)(Logo);

export default LogoConnect;
```

We separate the application state management primarily for testability, but it also allows us to use a component in multiple contexts (with or without Redux). The only reference to a connected component should be with in our route config.

## Component composition

When it comes to extracting components, there are two important factors to consider:
1. complexity of code (e.g. conditional rendering and other business logic)
2. reusability of code

We use the Atomic Design as our philosophy for creating reusable React components, along with additional co-located support files for each new component. However, sometimes an Atomic component itself might include complex business logic for rendering, or code that is reused only within that component, and extracting some of its pieces into their own components would help improve readability and maintainability of the code. If you see that these pieces need to be extracted into their own component, yet they do not warrant creating the additional supporting files, then simply create a co-located React component within the original component folder and import it into the original component. Any necessary styles, stories, or tests then live within the original support files.

In the example below, `CampaignMetadataIndicator`, is a molecule storybook component and it requires complex business for rendering several indicators. The `VelocityIndicator` and `ProximityIndicator` in the end both render the same molecule component, however they use widely different business logic and copy. Extracting these implementations into two separate components lets us clearly see the logic that the parent, `CampaignMetadataIndicator`, uses to decide which indicator to render. `VelocityIndicator` and `ProximityIndicator`, in turn, are responsible for logic specific to them. Since they are not being used anywhere else on the site, they do not warrant creation of a new storybook component (e.g. atom, molecule, ...), so they are kept within the same directory as their parent, `molecules/CampaignMetadataIndicator`.

In this case, both complexity and reusability played a role in the decision to extract the components. Reusability is frequently a more obvious reason, however, complexity alone could warrant extraction, depending on the situation. The goal is to improve readability of the code for us humans, which will make it easier for us to reason about and modify the code as needed in the future.

As [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#extracting-components) put it: "Don’t be afraid to split components into smaller components." :)

            <SlideIn>
                <VelocityIndicator />

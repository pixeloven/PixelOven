This document is general advice for working with React components.

## Referencing source files

To make referencing source files easier we have set up a `@shared` directory alias to simplify import declarations vs having to navigate up and down the directory tree. For example, to import a Logo Atom into another component we'd write:

```javascript
import { Logo } from "@shared/components/atoms/Logo";
```

Alternatively we can also create an `index.ts` file in the atoms directory and export all of our Atom components, allowing us to reference multiple at once.

_Note: Be extremely cautious when importing from a shared directory such as this. If the component we're importing into is exported from the same directory as the component we're importing, it will create a circular dependency. This can create bugs that are difficult to track down, slow down our application, or even create heap memory issues that result in our application crashing._

```javascript
import { Button, Link, Logo } from "@shared/components/atoms";
```

We provide a few aliases for our source directories, refer to the [Design Patterns documentation to learn more](/docs/reccommendations/design-patterns#source-file-structure-and-aliases).

## Supporting files

We rely on co-location for our component's supporting files, including styles, tests, stories, and documentation. We find co-locating the supporting files makes development far easier versus spreading them throughout the application. We highly recommend that all `stories.tsx` be accompanied by a `README.md` file to document and aid other developers working with the component.

The `index.ts` file is necessary, but only to export the component at the component directory level and shouldn't contain any other component code. For example, to export the component we'd write:

```javascript
/**
 * Register components here
 */
export { default as Logo } from "./Logo";

// We may also export the connected version if present
export { default as LogoConnected } from "./Logo.connect";
```

## Connecting a component to state

If this component needs to _connect_ to [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) state then it will also need a co-located connect file.

```
Logo.connect.ts
```

Here's a simplified example of what this file might look like.

```javascript
const makeMapStateToProps = () => {
    const mapStateToProps = (state: State, ownProps: OwnProps) => ({

    });
    return mapStateToProps;
};

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch: Dispatch, ownProps: OwnProps) => {

});

const LogoConnect = connect(
    makeMapStateToProps,
    mapDispatchToProps,
)(Logo);

export default LogoConnect;
```

We separate the application state management primarily for testability, but it also allows us to use a component in multiple contexts (with or without Redux). The only reference to a connected component should be with in our route config.

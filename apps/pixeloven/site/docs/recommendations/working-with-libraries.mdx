title: Working with libraries
---

When working with third party libraries we often find the library will lack type definitions (this is starting to improve as the community adopts TypeScript). In these situations we need to include community definitions, declare our own, or in extreme cases, ignore the lack of types.

## Community definitions

Generally the TypeScript community has or will create definitions for most scenarios. If you are using a library that doesn't include it's own types, try to search for the library in [DefinitelyTyped](https://definitelytyped.org/). If that fails you can also search NPM repository for `@types/*` where `*` is the package name. As a last resort, search Google before moving to the options below.

## Un-typed libraries

For un-typed libraries we recommend attempting to declare custom type definitions, but in some cases when that is too tedious or even impossible we have an option to move forward using module files.

### Declaration files

Declaring custom definitions for a library may be necessary when a module is un-typed or when using an external API.

> Note: This is the right way to import an un-typed module or file. However, it is a tedious process and so it is recommended to first search for types from the community (shown above) or if too cumbersome use module files (shown below).

#### Custom definitions

When defining types for a third party library we recommend following TypeScript's own [documentation for declaration files](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html).

#### External APIs

Typescript's built in type definitions do not include vendor-specific DOM specs. When working with custom external APIs we will often need to define our oun interfaces, for example when working with a specific API defined by an IE browser. Here we create a `dom.ie.d.ts` file and define the `msMatchesSelector` method within the `Element` interface.

```javascript
interface Element {
    msMatchesSelector(selectors: string): boolean;
}
```

For issues like this example, Google is your best friend. We found [this issue with a solution on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53040790/ts2339-property-msmatchesselector-does-not-exist-on-type-element?noredirect=1&lq=1).

### Module files

Generally this is meant to help define custom types for an un-typed module. However, for quicker integration we sometimes use this as a way to blanket accept a module without types.

> Note: This practice should be discourage for most cases so please **Use sparingly**

We start by locating or creating a `./src/modules.d.ts` file and declaring the module. For example:

```javascript
declare module "external-module-name";
```

Where `external-module-name` is the library name used for importing the module into your source.

```javascript
import woot from "external-module-name";
```

## Turning off type-checking

Occasionally, we may encounter situations where we need to disable type checking, for example when using a feature that is not supported by the current `@type/*` library. In these cases we will use one of the following to disable type-checking:

> Note: This practice should be discourage for most cases so please **Use sparingly**.

-   `// @ts-ignore`: disables checking for the next line
-   `// @ts-nocheck`: disables checking for the whole file
